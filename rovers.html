        <h2>DARUKA</h2>
        <h4>2024</h4>
        <p>Daruka features a double-rocker suspension system with a modular space frame chassis made of V-slot links, designed for
        enhanced accessibility. Capable of traversing rocky, sandy, and muddy terrains, it handles steep drops and climbs with
        ease. The ground clearance is optimized to avoid collisions with obstacles, while the double rocker system and bar
        differential maintain the center of gravity for reliable mobility.
        Powered by the Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, Daruka operates a 5 DOF robotic arm and an advanced science subsystem. The R&D
        department is focused on integrating a dynamic tracking system and inverse kinematics for better remote manipulation.</p>

            <h2>YYUVAAN</h2>
            <h4>2019-20</h4>
            <p>Built for the URC 2020, Yuvaan retained our signature four-wheel double rocker suspension for its high
                strength to
                weight ratio, uniform weight distribution, and increased stability. Featuring a revamped autonomous
                system with a custom
                framework that emphasized terrain mapping and contingencies, it allowed for efficient path
                pre-processing, avoiding
                non-traversable terrain while improving reliability. The science system of the rover however was the
                star of the show
                incorporating various techniques like spectral analysis, wet chemical analysis, and image processing.
                All these factors
                enabled Yuvaan to outshine its competition in the IRC 2020 where it ranked 2nd in Asia.</p>

            <p>2018 saw Team Roverx work on a new rover with concentration on enhancing the core design and
                architecture. Kratos was
                designed with the goal of achieving a high strength to weight ratio and making the rover more compact.
                The team was
                successful in reducing the weight by 20% in comparison to the previous rover Ares. We shifted to a
                4-wheel model which
                employed a double rocker suspension with a bar differential. A combination of motors and actuators were
                used to create a
                manipulator with 6 degrees of freedom. The electrical department shifted the entire power distribution
                assembly and
                control system onto custom made PCBs to increase space and energy efficiency. The communication with the
                rover was
                established using ROS framework. A fully automated light weight soil collection mechanism was designed
                to provide a
                detailed soil profile.</p>

            <h4>2017</h4>
            <p>Ares was the team's debut rover in the University Rover Challenge held in 2018. The main objective while
                designing Ares
                was to simplify the design, have onboard backup systems and ease of control to make sure tasks are
                completed with ease.
                With a chassis designed with a factor of safety of about 3 and a three rocker suspension system, the
                rover could
                traverse extreme martian terrain with ease. The rover was also equipped with a state of the art science
                system employing
                site selection and documentation, sensor data acquisition, sample caching and laboratory analysis. With
                all these
                features, the rover was fully equipped to assist astronauts on martian missions and proved itself in
                competition.</p>

                ERC 2016, Poland.
                It was well monitored in terms of safety, scalability and reliability. The Rover also provided wireless
                capability to
                establish a reliable connection with the base station. It also had GPS technology embedded in it to
                display its current
                location. In addition to these, it also featured two manipulators and other electrical housings mounted
                on an aluminium
                frame. The rover employed a total of 4 cameras mounted at different positions in order to aid rover
                operation during
                various tasks with ease. It was also equipped with a custom-made safety system which is designed to
                ensure the safety
                for the rover in emergency situations. The complete assembly weighed 49kgs.</p>

            <h4>2015</h4>
            <p>The Rover, Enigma MK1, marked our team's debut in representing our college and country in international
                competitions
                such as the ERC, Poland. In doing so, it gathered huge appreciation from other teams, besides winning
                several accolades
                and setting the benchmark for our future rovers. This rover featured 3 independent rocker suspension
                systems, with the
                maximum angle of rotation of its rocker being 45°, and a good ground clearance of 100mm. It could easily
                be controlled
                from any personal computer (connected to the same Wi-Fi network) using a Secure Shell (SSH), without the
                need for any
                extra software and video feeds. All its features made the Rover prepared to perform its required
                Science, Blind Terrain
