                Team RoverX is a group of young, enthusiastic individuals who build Mars rovers by the year to display
                and
                compete at
                various platforms. A part of Creation Labs VIT University, we seek to bring our ideas to life by
                innovating
                and working
                hard on our projects. The awards and accolades we've achieved are only proof that we've delivered
                consistently.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our prototype is used to compete in different international competitions including
                IRC
                (International Rover Challenege), URC (University Rover Challenge), ERC
                (European Rover Challenge) and ARC (Anatolian Rover Challenge). These competitions provide a
                platform for student-run
                teams from all over the globe to showcase their respective rovers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Working on our rover exposes us to various other practical and theoretical disciplines of engineering,
                thereby providing
                depth to our knowledge. As a team, we begin to understand the work culture in industries and
                problem-solving
                in
                real-time, while following a timeline based approach. These are merely stepping stones to the
                engineering
                world we all
                aspire to be a part of.
